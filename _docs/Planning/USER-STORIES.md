## Persona - Teacher (Ms. Lee)

Is a middle-aged teacher who's been teaching at Willowdale middle school for 10 years. She is in charge of a class of 25 grade 6 students. Some of her students have learning difficulties.

Ms. Lee teaches Math, History, ELA (English) /  French / Science, and each subject has 1-2 assignments every week.

Since COVID and transition to online classes in Google classroom, it has been difficult for her to properly assign homework to her students because students often have a hard time finding the correct assignments in the google classroom platform.  It's also hard for her to keep track of who has completed the work.

Some of her students with LD needs modified assignments and be reminded of the assignments, and it's hard for Ms. Lee to keep track of the modified assignment details on top of all the other regular assignments, which students often seem to miss or don't realize exist at all.

Reading assignments take extra long time. Jake requires additional time to complete assignments.  Prefers to have audio instructions for assignments, and also benefits from having someone transcribe some of his assignments which may have medium to long writing components.  He requires additional time for any math assignments.

Jake doesn't like written instructions because he has a hard time understanding the message.  He has trouble being organized and taking notes. He has trouble with keeping track of multi-step directions, and can become frustrated and discouraged.

## Persona - Student (LD) (Kayla)

Age 12 - Dysnemkinesia

Kayla's parents are both very involved in her education and often volunteer whenever there's a field trip or other activities at the school.  They are open to new research and ideas for helping Kayla succeed, and often trying new things to see if they would help her.

Kayla is a practical learner and thrives in very vocal and visual environments.  Because of her motor difficulties, she may require extensions on some of her projects, because, although she is capable of doing the work, sometimes she has difficulty typing or writing.  She benefits greatly from having an aide who can transcribe what she is saying (usually her Mom or Dad).

Kayla is a keen learner, but gets agitated when she is assigned tasks that require precise hand movements, like using a computer or writing on pen and paper.

Jose is a quick learner, and prefers to not procrastinate, he likes to mentally schedule his tasks so he knows when and how much time he needs to stay ahead so that he can spend time with his peers.
